This project was carried out as an assignment of the UCA DSAI course "Distributed big data system" class.

The evaluation overview is as follows: 

Apache Spark should be used(e.g. on Google Cloud as we did during our lab sessions).
Build a full machine learning pipeline, using a previously chosen dataset:
 * reading data
 * transforming data (extracting features, dealing with missing values if any, etc)
 * building models (build at least two models to compare, e.g. a random forest with 100 vs 200 trees or Lasso vs Ridge regressions)
 * evaluating quality (use cross-validation or train/test split)

# Project Overview :  Loan Prediction Based on Customer Behavior
### Goal
Predict who possible Defaulters are for the Consumer Loans Product.
### Inspiration
An organization wants to predict who possible defaulters are for the consumer loans product. 
They have data about historic customer behavior based on what they have observed. 
Hence when they acquire new customers they want to predict who is riskier and who is not.
